This is a personal CV website built with React, designed to showcase my background, skills, and projects in a clean and responsive layout.

The project focuses on practicing React component structure, reusable UI blocks and responsive design. It includes sections like About Me, Educational Background, Projects, and Contact, and was developed as part of my learning journey.
